ImportC implements all but three of the MSVC intrinsics [listed here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240412171516/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ie/cpp/intrinsics/alphabetical-listing-of-intrinsic-functions?view=msvc-170), and a handful of undocumented intrinsics.

ImportC now implements all but three of the MSVC intrinsics [listed here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240412171516/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ie/cpp/intrinsics/alphabetical-listing-of-intrinsic-functions?view=msvc-170), and a handful of undocumented intrinsics.
The MSVC intrinsics are available when targeting the Microsoft C runtime (that is, when the `CRuntime_Microsoft` version identifier is defined).
